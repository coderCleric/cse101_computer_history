\section{Introduction}

This document is an example of Assignment 3 in CSE/IT101.
You should describe what topic you chose and
why you chose that topic. Also provide a summary of the
topic, in a general sense. This section should describe any
background information that the reader needs to know to
understand your topic.

\section{CDC 6600 - 1964}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The CDC 6600 was widely considered to be one of the very first super computers. By today's standards its hardware is far from even common laptops. It only had 1 CPU with 1 core running at 40MHz. Today its common to see computers running with 4-8 cores all running at around 4GHz, a several orders of magnitude of improvement from the CDC 6600. Interestingly this computer produced so much heat that it had to be cooled with Freon cooling system that is very similar to water cooling systems used in enthusiast and super computers alike today. All of these systems combined to produce a system that could output just over 3 million flops (floating point operations) per second.   
\subsection{Software}

You should describe the time period in which your topic was
invented or used here. Also include the context for why your
topic was created or for how it is used. Any specific historical
information should be included here.

\section{Intel Paragon - 1993}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The Intel Paragon was a clear step towards modern super computers used today. Rather than using a single CPU like the CDC 6600, the Paragon used up to 4000 CPUs in parallel to improve computing efficiency and total power of the system. The Paragon was one of the early adopters of the node based super computer architecture that is still widely used in the most powerful computers of today. Instead of functioning as a single computer, the super computer functions as clusters (nodes) of computers in order to better divide up the power of the entire network more effectively. The Paragon was recorded as being able to compute at 143.40 gigaflops per second. 
\subsection{Software}

You should list the specification of any hardware your topic
uses here. If you want make a table here, please label the table
and include discussion on what components are included in the
table and why. See Table
\ref{tbl:example} for an example of a table.
The labels/captions of the table should be put at the bottom
of the table.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c||} 
\hline
  & Col1 & Col2 & Col3 \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
Row1 & (1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) \\ 
\hline
Row2 & (2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) \\
\hline
Row3 & (3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of a table}
\label{tbl:example}
\end{center}
\end{table}

You might want to put figures in the document. Please
remember to label them. The labels/captions of the figures
should be put at the bottom of the figure. See Figure
\ref{fig:example} for an example of how to use figures.
You will need to place the figure in an \texttt{images/} folder
in your working directory.

\section{Summit (IBM) - 2019}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The Summit is the most powerful super computer in the world at the time of writing. While using all of its 27,648 NVidia Volta V100 GPUs at once it can produce over 200 petaflops per second. The system consists of 4,608 compute nodes that each individually can compute over 42 terraflops per second. The system is cooled by a complex water cooling loop to increase the density of the supercomputer and increase the amount of computing power available per server rack. When operating at full power the entire computer network draws over 13 megawatts of power.
\subsection{Software}

Describe the software used for your chosen topic if any,
and state any uses of the software that your topic had.
If your topic does not have or use software, describe why it
doesn't use software and how it functions without it.

\section{CONCLUSION}

Conclude your research paper with any reflections on what you
learned about your topic. Was this what you expected to find?
Did you find any facts that surprised you? You may add other
personal reflections about the topic here.
