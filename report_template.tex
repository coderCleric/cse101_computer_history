\section{Introduction}

This document is an example of Assignment 3 in CSE/IT101.
You should describe what topic you chose and
why you chose that topic. Also provide a summary of the
topic, in a general sense. This section should describe any
background information that the reader needs to know to
understand your topic.

\section{CDC 6600 - 1964}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The CDC 6600 was widely considered to be one of the very first super computers. By today's standards its hardware is far from even common laptops. It only had 1 CPU with 1 core running at 40MHz. Today its common to see computers running with 4-8 cores all running at around 4GHz, a several orders of magnitude of improvement from the CDC 6600. Interestingly this computer produced so much heat that it had to be cooled with Freon cooling system that is very similar to water cooling systems used in enthusiast and super computers alike today. All of these systems combined to produce a system that could output just over 3 million flops (floating point operations) per second.   
\subsection{Software}
NCAR's Computing Facility first acquired the CDC 6600 in 1964. 
Only a year later in 1965, the computing facility was behind in 
development for software for the CDC 6600. The two operating 
system available for use on the CDC were SPIROS (Simultaneous
Processing Operating System) and COS (Chippewa Operating System). 
Both operating systems were inefficient at running the code 
developed by NCAR. Therefore, they determined the computer would 
need it's own OS, and one was built using a 6600 simulator for 
another computer, the CDC 3600. In the end, before it's 
decommission, the CDC 6600 had it's own OS, program library, and 
FORTRAN 66 compiler. It also ran some early video games made by 
the NCAR engineers, including games similar to Lunar Lander, Space
Wars, and baseball.

\section{Intel Paragon - 1993}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The Intel Paragon was a clear step towards modern super computers used today. Rather than using a single CPU like the CDC 6600, the Paragon used up to 4000 CPUs in parallel to improve computing efficiency and total power of the system. The Paragon was one of the early adopters of the node based super computer architecture that is still widely used in the most powerful computers of today. Instead of functioning as a single computer, the super computer functions as clusters (nodes) of computers in order to better divide up the power of the entire network more effectively. The Paragon was recorded as being able to compute at 143.40 gigaflops per second. 
\subsection{Software}
The Intel Paragon was supplied by Intel to Sandia National Labs in
1994, with an OS designed by Intel. The OS provided by Intel,
OSF-1, failed to work well with the scale of the project at Sandia
National Labs. Instead of using OSF-1, the engineers at Sandia
National Labs ported their own OS over to the Intel Paragon,
SUNMOS. The kernel was designed specifically to be lightweight,
and it was later replaced by another lightweight kernel, PUMA.
Lightweight kernels were used, presumably, to save processing
power, so that the power of the supercomputer could be maximized.

The labels/captions of the table should be put at the bottom
of the table.


\begin{table}[h!]

You might want to put figures in the document. Please
remember to label them. The labels/captions of the figures
should be put at the bottom of the figure. See Figure
\ref{fig:example} for an example of how to use figures.
You will need to place the figure in an \texttt{images/} folder
in your working directory.

\section{Summit (IBM) - 2019}
\subsection{Time Period}
\subsection{Hardware}
The Summit is the most powerful super computer in the world at the time of writing. While using all of its 27,648 NVidia Volta V100 GPUs at once it can produce over 200 petaflops per second. The system consists of 4,608 compute nodes that each individually can compute over 42 terraflops per second. The system is cooled by a complex water cooling loop to increase the density of the supercomputer and increase the amount of computing power available per server rack. When operating at full power the entire computer network draws over 13 megawatts of power.
\subsection{Software}
For security reasons, Oak Ridge National Laboratories newest
supercomputer runs on an unknown and unreleased OS. The specific
software being used on the Summit is also unknown, however the
areas being affected by the computer are know. The computer's main
purpose is to run complex modeling programs in various scientific
fields, including biology, materials, and of course, computer
science. The Summit is the first computer to complete an exascale
(billion billion calculations per second) scientific calculation
in genomics. The Summit also applies complex AI and machine
learning algorithms to scientific fields such as human health and
physics. Overall, the Summit is applying the power of super
computing software to solve problems in many scientific fields.

Describe the software used for your chosen topic if any,
and state any uses of the software that your topic had.
If your topic does not have or use software, describe why it
doesn't use software and how it functions without it.
